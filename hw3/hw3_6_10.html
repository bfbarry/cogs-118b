<br>%%  if v is an eigenvector of matrix AA'  with eigenvalue lambda
<br>%%   then    AA'v = lambda v
<br>%%   and multiplying both sides on the left by A' we get
<br>%%          A'AA'v = A' lambda v
<br>%%          A'AA'v = lambda A'v (because lambda is a scalar we can move
<br>%                                change it's order)
<br>%%          A'A(A'v) = lambda(A'v)    just regrouping
<br>%%    Therefore A'v is a eigenvector of A'A with eigenvalue lambda (the
<br>%                                                      same eigenvalue)

<br>A = [1 2 3; 1 2 1; 2 4 5]; % Create the A matrix
<br>x = rand(3, 1); % Create a random 3 x 1 vector
<br>display(x); % Display it
<br>for i = 1:5 % Start a loop that will execute 5 times
<br>    x = (A * x) / norm(A * x); % Multiply x by A and normalize, put result back in x
<br>    display(x); % Display it
<br>end % Close the loop
<br>[V, D] = eig(A); % Calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues of A
<br>display(V); % Display the eigenvectors
<br>%% The answer for 4 is a close approximation of the eigenvector with the
<br>%%largest eigenvalue from 5.  
<br>%%  
<br>%% When A is replaced by a 3x3 identity matrix, every unit length vector
<br>%% stays the same.  (e.g. x=A*x/||A*x|| for all unit length x)
<br>%% Every (non-zero) vector is an eigenvector of the identity matrix 
<br>%% (Note that all 3 unit vectors returned have the same eigenvalue--  %% this means 
<br>%% all linear combinations of these vectors have the same eigenvalue(1) and 
<br>%% in this case all vectors of eigenvector (with eigenvalue 1)
