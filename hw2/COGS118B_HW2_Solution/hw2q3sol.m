% Part 3 %

% During first 5 flips, the posterior distribution with the Beta(a=50,
% b=50) doesnâ€™t change much, while the posterior distribution with each
% of the other 2 priors varies a lot. We can think of the prior - Beta
% distribution in Bayesian estimation as adding fake data into our
% experiment. In our case, a Beta(a=50,b=50) as the prior is equivalent
% to adding 100 "fake" flips, in which 50 of them are heads, and with
% this prior, 5 "real" flips don't have a strong impact on the posterior
% probability. Compared with Beta(a=50,b=50), Beta(a=1,b=1) is similar
% to adding 2 "fake" flips, and one of them is head, thus during 5
% flips, we observed that the posterior distribution varies a lot since
% the "real" flips gradually takes control of the posterior.

% Part 4 %

% As we think of the Beta prior as adding "fake" flips into our "real
% experiments, when there is a large amount of data, unless we have a
% strong prior belief of what the parameters should be, the "real" data
% becomes more dominant in determining the posterior distribution, and
% potentially overwrites the impact from the prior. After thousands of
% flips, the posterior distributions with 3 different priors get closer
% and more similar to each other.
